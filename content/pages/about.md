# Why Kinoora? A Founder's Story

## Founder's Note

Hi, I'm Daniel—founder of **kinoora**, filmmaker, and actor. My journey in the film world has been filled with passion, creativity, and, honestly, a lot of obstacles. I've seen firsthand how hard it is for indie filmmakers to get their work seen, whether it's a film, a series, or a short, and to be treated fairly.

Kinoora is my answer to those struggles. I created this platform to open doors for filmmakers who want to tell their stories without compromise—and for audiences who want to discover something real and new. My mission is simple: make it easier for all filmmakers to share their vision and for viewers to experience the future of indie cinema and series.
