17:T1023,<h1>The Future of Independent Cinema is Here</h1>
<p>After years in the film industry as both a filmmaker and actor, I&#39;ve witnessed firsthand the struggles that independent creators face. The gatekeeping, the compromises, the unfair revenue splits—it all led me to one conclusion: we need something better.</p>
<p>That&#39;s why I&#39;m building <strong>kinoora</strong>.</p>
<h2>The Problem with Current Platforms</h2>
<p>Traditional streaming platforms and distribution channels have created a system that doesn&#39;t serve independent creators:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rights retention issues</strong>: Many platforms demand exclusivity or significant rights transfers</li>
<li><strong>Unfair revenue sharing</strong>: Creators see only a fraction of what their work generates</li>
<li><strong>Algorithmic suppression</strong>: Independent content gets buried under mainstream productions</li>
<li><strong>Limited audience connection</strong>: No real way for filmmakers to connect with their viewers</li>
<li><strong>One-size-fits-all approach</strong>: No consideration for the unique needs of indie creators</li>
</ul>
<h2>Our Vision for Change</h2>
<p>At kinoora, we&#39;re building something different—a platform designed specifically for independent filmmakers and the audiences who love authentic storytelling.</p>
<h3>For Filmmakers</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>100% rights retention</strong>: Your work remains yours, always</li>
<li><strong>Fair monetization</strong>: Transparent revenue sharing that actually benefits creators</li>
<li><strong>No exclusivity requirements</strong>: Share your work wherever you want</li>
<li><strong>Advanced analytics</strong>: Real insights about your audience and what resonates</li>
<li><strong>Global reach</strong>: Subtitle translation services to connect with worldwide audiences</li>
<li><strong>Direct audience engagement</strong>: Build genuine relationships with your viewers</li>
</ul>
<h3>For Viewers</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discovery innovation</strong>: Our TikTok-style trailer feed makes finding new content fun and intuitive</li>
<li><strong>Behind-the-scenes access</strong>: Connect directly with filmmakers and learn about their creative process</li>
<li><strong>Diverse content</strong>: Stories and perspectives you won&#39;t find on mainstream platforms</li>
<li><strong>Community interaction</strong>: Discuss films with other passionate cinephiles</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why Now?</h2>
<p>The independent film landscape is ready for disruption. Audiences are hungry for authentic stories, and filmmakers are seeking alternatives to traditional distribution models. The technology exists to create better solutions—we just need to build them with the right priorities.</p>
<h3>The Founding Filmmaker Program</h3>
<p>We&#39;re launching with just 50 founding filmmakers who will help shape the platform from the ground up. These pioneers will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get early access to all features</li>
<li>Receive boosted revenue shares during their first year</li>
<li>Have direct input on platform development</li>
<li>Join an exclusive community of creators</li>
<li>Earn a special founding filmmaker badge</li>
</ul>
<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>We&#39;re launching in Q4 2025, starting in the EU and UK, with plans for global expansion in 2026. This timeline gives us the opportunity to build something truly special—not just another streaming platform, but a community where independent cinema can thrive.</p>
<h2>Join the Movement</h2>
<p>Whether you&#39;re a filmmaker ready to take control of your distribution or a viewer seeking stories that matter, kinoora is being built for you. </p>
<p>This isn&#39;t just about technology—it&#39;s about creating a sustainable ecosystem where independent voices can be heard, where creativity is rewarded fairly, and where the connection between storytellers and their audiences is genuine and meaningful.</p>
<p>The future of independent cinema starts now. Are you ready to be part of it?</p>
